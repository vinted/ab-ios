Vinted AB testing framework.
* What it is - Vinted AB testing framework is used to determine
whether an identifier belongs to a particular ab test and which
variant of that ab test. Identifiers will usually represent users,
but other scenario are possible.
* High-level description - Identifiers are divided into some
number of buckets, using hashing. Before a test is started,
buckets are chosen for that test. That gives the ability to
pick the needed level of isolation. Each test also has a seed,
which is used to randomise how users are divided among test
variants.
