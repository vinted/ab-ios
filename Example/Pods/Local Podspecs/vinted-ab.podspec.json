  "description": "Vinted AB testing framework.\n* What it is - Vinted AB testing framework is used to determine\nwhether an identifier belongs to a particular ab test and which\nvariant of that ab test. Identifiers will usually represent users,\nbut other scenario are possible.\n* High-level description - Identifiers are divided into some\nnumber of buckets, using hashing. Before a test is started,\nbuckets are chosen for that test. That gives the ability to\npick the needed level of isolation. Each test also has a seed,\nwhich is used to randomise how users are divided among test\nvariants.",
